- Budget allocation based on historical performance data
- A/B testing required for major content changes

### 3. Brand Consistency

- All content must align with brand voice and guidelines
- Visual assets must follow design system
- Messaging must be coherent across channels

### 4. Audience-Centric

- Segment audiences before campaign planning
- Personalization based on audience attributes
- Regular audience feedback collection and analysis
