## 🎯 Specifications vs Instances

| Aspect | specs/ (This Directory) | config/ + templates/ + data/ + src/ |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Strategy specs | Implementation & execution |
| **Content** | How to do marketing | Executable code & configurations |
| **Format** | Markdown (spec.md) | YAML, Markdown, JSON, TypeScript |
| **Generated by** | Commands 1-7 (SDM) | Command 8 (/marketspec.implement) |
| **Example** | Q1 strategy document | Campaign code + config + templates |

### Complete Workflow

```
1. Define Strategy (specs/)
   → Talk to AI: "Define Q1 social media marketing strategy"
   → AI uses commands 1-7 (/marketspec.specify, plan, tasks, etc.)
   → Generates specs/001-q1-social-strategy/*.md
   → Content: objectives, audience, channels, budget strategy, tasks

2. Implement (config/ + templates/ + data/ + src/)
   → Talk to AI: "Implement 001-q1-social-strategy"
   → AI uses /marketspec.implement (command 8)
   → Generates:
     - config/001-q1-social-strategy.yaml (campaign config)
     - templates/001-q1-social-strategy/*.md (content templates)
     - src/campaigns/001-q1-social-strategy.ts (executable code)

3. Execute Campaign (run generated code)
   → Run: ts-node src/campaigns/001-q1-social-strategy.ts
   → Code loads config, renders templates, calls MCP tools
   → Collects data → data/001-q1-social-strategy/*.json

4. Review & Optimize (specs/)
   → AI uses /marketspec.review (reads data/)
   → Generates specs/001-q1-social-strategy/review.md
   → AI uses /marketspec.optimize
   → Generates specs/001-q1-social-strategy/optimize.md

## 🎯 How to Create Strategy Specifications

### ❌ Don't: Manual Template Filling

```
# Not recommended
1. Look for empty template file
2. Manually fill 100+ fields
3. Unsure if correct
4. Spend hours filling forms
```

### ✅ Do: AI-Driven Generation

```
# Recommended approach
1. Talk to AI about your marketing needs
2. AI uses spec commands (from .marketingspeckit/commands/)
3. AI generates complete, validated strategy specs
4. Review and iterate with AI assistance

Example conversation:
You: "I need to define Q1 2025 product launch marketing strategy"
AI: "Great! Let me help you define the strategy. A few questions:
     - Who is the target audience?
     - What are the marketing goals (awareness/conversion/retention)?
     - What's the budget range?"
You: [Answer questions]
AI: [Generates specs/001-q1-launch-strategy/spec.md]
You: "Can we add social media engagement strategy?"
AI: [Updates specification document]
```

## 📂 Directory Structure (Markdown Strategy Documents)

After generating strategy specifications, `specs/` will look like:

```
specs/
├── 001-q1-launch-strategy/
│   ├── spec.md                 ← Strategy specification (Markdown)
│   ├── research/
│   │   └── audience-analysis.md
│   └── assets/
│       └── brand-guidelines.md
├── 002-social-media-strategy/
│   ├── spec.md                 ← Strategy specification (Markdown)
│   └── content-pillars.md
├── 003-content-strategy/
│   └── spec.md                 ← Strategy specification (Markdown)
└── README.md                   ← This file
```

**Each strategy specification (spec.md) includes**:
- Background & Objectives (Why: Why do this)
- Target Audience Analysis (Who: For whom)
- Marketing Strategy & Channel Selection (How: How to do it)
- Content Strategy & Creative Direction (What: What to do)
- Budget Strategy & Resource Allocation (Resources: What to use)
- Success Metrics & Evaluation Methods (Metrics: How to measure)
- Risks & Mitigation Measures (Risks: How to respond)

**Note**:
- specs/ stores strategy specifications (Markdown), not concrete data
- Implementation files (config, templates, code) are stored in `config/`, `templates/`, `src/`
- Runtime data is collected in `data/`
- Define strategy first (specs/), then implement (command 8), then execute (run code)
