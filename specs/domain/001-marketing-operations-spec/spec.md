# Marketing Operations Specification

**Version**: 0.3.0  
**Status**: Draft (Development Phase)  
**Domain**: Marketing Operations  
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-16  
**Note**: API unstable during 0.x development phase

---

## Overview

### Purpose

The **Marketing Operations Specification** defines a standardized framework for managing marketing activities, content creation, channel distribution, and campaign execution. This specification enables:

1. **Structured Campaign Definition**: Define marketing campaigns with clear goals, budgets, timelines, and target audiences
2. **Brand Consistency**: Maintain consistent brand voice and guidelines across all marketing materials
3. **AI-Driven Content Generation**: Guide AI agents in creating platform-appropriate, brand-consistent content
4. **Tool Integration**: Support MCP-first automation for scheduling, publishing, and analytics
5. **Marketing Analytics**: Track campaign performance with standard metrics (CTR, CPM, ROAS)

### Problem Statement

Open source projects and product teams face challenges in:
- **Inconsistent Branding**: Marketing materials lack unified voice and style
- **Manual Content Creation**: Time-consuming, repetitive content generation tasks
- **Channel Fragmentation**: Different platforms require different content formats
- **Poor Tool Integration**: Marketing tools don't work together seamlessly
- **Unclear ROI**: Difficulty tracking campaign effectiveness

This specification solves these problems by providing a declarative, spec-driven approach to marketing operations.

### Target Users

- **Open Source Project Maintainers**: Need to promote projects, attract contributors
- **Product Teams**: Require structured marketing campaign management
- **Independent Developers**: Want to market products without marketing expertise
- **Marketing Operations Professionals**: Seek standardized marketing workflows

---

## Glossary

- **Project**: Top-level entity representing a product, service, or initiative with its brand identity
- **Product**: Specific feature, offering, or component within a Project (e.g., "SDS Commands", "Speckit Generator")
- **Campaign**: Time-bound marketing activity with defined goals, budget, and target audience
- **Channel**: Distribution platform or medium (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, Email, Blog)
- **Tool**: MCP server or REST API integration for automating marketing tasks
- **ContentTemplate**: Brand guidelines, style rules, and content constraints
- **Milestone**: Significant event or release that triggers marketing activities
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Prioritized integration method for tool automation
- **AI Agent**: LLM-based assistant (e.g., Claude, GPT) that reads specs and generates content
- **Slash Command**: AI-accessible operation prefixed with `/` for reading specs or executing tasks (e.g., `/marketing.campaign`, `/marketing.generate.post`)

### Marketing Metrics

- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: Percentage of users who click on content (industry avg: 2-5%)
- **CPM (Cost Per Mille)**: Cost per 1000 impressions (typical social media: $5-15)
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**: Revenue generated per dollar spent (good: 3:1 or higher)
- **CPC (Cost Per Click)**: Cost per individual click on content

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: MetaSpec Framework Launch Campaign

**Scenario**: MetaSpec v0.6.0 is ready for release. The team wants to promote the new version across multiple channels with consistent messaging.

**Entities Involved**:
- **Project**: MetaSpec (brand voice: "Technical, Approachable")
- **Product**: Speckit Generator v0.6.0
- **Campaign**: "v0.6.0 Launch" (goal: awareness, budget: $500, duration: 2 weeks)
- **Channels**: Twitter, Reddit (r/programming), Dev.to Blog
- **Tools**: Twitter MCP, Reddit API
- **ContentTemplate**: Technical blog post style, 800-2000 words
- **Milestone**: MetaSpec v0.6.0 Release (2025-11-15)

**Workflow**:
1. AI Agent reads `/marketing.project` → Gets MetaSpec brand identity
2. AI Agent reads `/marketing.campaign` → Gets v0.6.0 launch goals
3. AI Agent calls `/marketing.generate.post` → Creates Twitter announcement (280 chars)
4. AI Agent calls `/marketing.generate.article` → Creates Dev.to blog post (1500 words)
5. AI Agent calls `/marketing.execute.publish` → Posts via Twitter MCP tool
6. Tracks metrics (CTR, engagement) → Updates Campaign status

**Value**: Consistent brand messaging across platforms, automated content generation, tool-driven execution.

### Use Case 2: Independent Developer Product Launch

**Scenario**: Solo developer launches a new VS Code extension and needs to market it without a marketing background.

**Entities Involved**:
- **Project**: "CodeSnippet Pro" (brand voice: "Friendly, Developer-focused")
- **Product**: VS Code Extension v1.0
- **Campaign**: "Launch Week" (goal: conversion, target: 1000 installs)
- **Channels**: Twitter, Product Hunt, Reddit
- **ContentTemplate**: Short-form social posts, casual tone

**Workflow**:
1. Developer defines Project and Campaign specs (YAML)
2. AI Agent generates platform-specific content automatically
3. Developer reviews and approves content
4. AI Agent schedules posts across multiple platforms
5. Tracks installs and engagement metrics

**Value**: Low barrier to entry, no marketing expertise required, AI-guided best practices.

## Workflow Specification

**Purpose**: Define the complete user workflow from strategic planning to performance optimization, ensuring users understand how to use the toolkit end-to-end.

### Overview

Marketing operations follow a **5-phase workflow** from strategic planning to performance analysis. Each phase has clear entry/exit criteria, mapped operations, and quality gates.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Marketing Operations Workflow                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Phase 1: Strategic Planning
   ↓ (Define Plan: objectives, budget, KPIs)
   
Phase 2: Campaign Design
   ↓ (Design Campaigns based on Plan)
   
Phase 3: Content Creation
   ↓ (Generate content for Campaigns)
   
Phase 4: Execution & Publishing
   ↓ (Publish content to Channels)
   
Phase 5: Analytics & Optimization
   ↓ (Track KPIs, optimize based on data)
   
   Decision: KPI met?
      YES → Next Campaign or Next Plan
      NO  → Optimize → Back to Phase 3 or 4
   
   ↺ Loop continues
```

---

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning

**Purpose**: Define marketing strategy and resource allocation

**Entry Criteria**:
- Business goals defined
- Project and Product specifications ready

**Operations**:
- `/marketing.plan.create` - Create marketing plan
- `/marketing.plan.validate` - Verify plan completeness
- `/marketing.plan.get` - Retrieve plan details
- `/marketing.plan.analyze` - Get AI improvement suggestions

**Exit Criteria**:
- Plan status = "approved"
- All P0 KPIs defined
- Budget allocation = 100%
- At least 2 target audience segments defined

**Quality Gate**: Plan must pass validation (score ≥ 80/100)

### Workflow Best Practices

**1. Always Start with Plan**
```
❌ Bad: Create Campaign directly
✅ Good: Create Plan → Design Campaign → Execute
```

**2. Use AI Assistance**
```
❌ Bad: Manually define 5 campaigns
✅ Good: /marketing.campaign.design to get AI suggestions
```

**3. Monitor and Optimize**
```
❌ Bad: Publish and forget
✅ Good: Weekly analytics review → optimize based on data
```

**4. Follow Quality Gates**
```
❌ Bad: Skip validation, publish immediately
✅ Good: Validate Plan → Check Campaign budget → Review content → Publish
```

## Quality Validation

This specification includes quality validation tools to ensure completeness, consistency, and adherence to constitution principles.

### Validation Artifacts

- **Checklists**: `checklists/comprehensive-quality.md` - 50-item quality checklist covering entity definitions, operations, validation rules, error handling, examples, and constitution alignment
- **Analysis Reports**: `analysis/` directory
  - `quick-analysis.md` - Structural integrity check (frontmatter, cross-references, dependencies)
  - `full-analysis.md` - Comprehensive semantic quality analysis (11 dimensions)

### Running Quality Checks

**Manual Checklist Review**:
1. Open `checklists/comprehensive-quality.md`
2. Review 50 checklist items across 6 categories
3. Mark items as ✅ Pass, ⚠️ Partial, or ❌ Missing
4. Document evidence with spec.md line numbers

**Automated Analysis** (via MetaSpec commands):
```bash
# Quick structural check (<2 min)
/metaspec.sds.analyze quick

# Full semantic analysis (5-10 min)
/metaspec.sds.analyze

# Focused dimension check
/metaspec.sds.analyze check entities
/metaspec.sds.analyze check operations
```

### Current Quality Metrics

**Overall Score**: 92% (A grade) - Excellent

| Dimension | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Structural Integrity | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| Entity Definitions | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| Validation Rules | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| Operations | 95% | ✅ PASS |
| Schema Consistency | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| Error Handling | 85% | ✅ PASS |
| Examples Coverage | 95% | ✅ PASS |
| Constitution Alignment | 95% | ✅ PASS |

**Issues**: 5 MEDIUM (improvements, not blockers), 1 LOW (terminology consistency)

### Quality Standards

This specification adheres to:
- **Constitution Part II**: Specification Design Principles (6 principles)
- **MetaSpec Best Practices**: Entity-First, Validation Completeness, Operation Semantics
- **Domain Fidelity**: Marketing standards (ROAS, CTR, CPM, AIDA funnel)

### Before Toolkit Implementation

**Recommended**: Ensure quality score ≥ 90% before proceeding to `/metaspec.sdd.specify`

Current status: ✅ **Ready for toolkit development** (92% score)
