# Marketing Operations Specification

**Version**: 0.3.0  
**Status**: Draft (Development Phase)  
**Domain**: Marketing Operations  
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-17  
**Note**: API unstable during 0.x development phase

---

## Overview

### Purpose

The **Marketing Operations Specification** defines a standardized data structure for managing marketing activities, content creation, channel distribution, and campaign execution. This specification enables:

1. **Structured Campaign Definition**: Define marketing campaigns with clear goals, budgets, timelines, and target audiences
2. **Brand Consistency**: Maintain consistent brand voice and guidelines across all marketing materials
3. **Strategic Planning**: Link tactical campaigns to strategic marketing plans with measurable KPIs
4. **Performance Analytics**: Track campaign performance and optimization recommendations
5. **Tool Integration**: Support MCP-first automation for scheduling, publishing, and analytics

### Problem Statement

Open source projects and product teams face challenges in:
- **Inconsistent Branding**: Marketing materials lack unified voice and style
- **Ad-hoc Campaign Management**: No structured approach to planning and tracking campaigns
- **Unclear Strategic Alignment**: Campaigns disconnected from business objectives
- **Poor Performance Tracking**: Difficulty measuring campaign effectiveness
- **Tool Fragmentation**: Marketing tools don't work together seamlessly

This specification solves these problems by providing a declarative, spec-driven data structure for marketing operations.

### Target Users

- **Marketing Teams**: Require structured campaign management and performance tracking
- **Open Source Project Maintainers**: Need to promote projects and attract contributors
- **Product Teams**: Seek standardized marketing workflow execution
- **AI Agents**: Automated tools that create and manage marketing content based on specifications

### Referential Integrity

- `product.project_id` must reference existing `project.name`
- `plan.project_id` must reference existing `project.name`
- `campaign.plan_id` must reference existing `plan.id` (REQUIRED since v0.2.0)
- `campaign.project_id` must reference existing `project.name`
- `campaign.product_ids` must reference existing `product.id` values

## Domain Workflows

### Standard Marketing Operations Workflow

Marketing operations typically follow this **5-phase workflow**:

```
Phase 1: Strategic Planning
    ↓
Phase 2: Campaign Design
    ↓
Phase 3: Content Creation
    ↓
Phase 4: Execution
    ↓
Phase 5: Analytics & Optimization
    ↓
(Loop back to Phase 1 for next cycle)
```

---

#### Phase 1: Strategic Planning

**Purpose**: Define marketing objectives, allocate budget, and establish measurable KPIs

**Key Activities**:
- Define business objectives (1-5 objectives, P0/P1/P2 prioritization)
- Identify target audience segments (primary/secondary/tertiary)
- Allocate budget across categories
- Set measurable KPIs (1-10 metrics with targets)
- Define marketing strategies (1-8 strategies)

**Entities Created**:
- `MarketingPlan` (status: draft → review → approved)

**Typical Duration**: 1-2 weeks

**Success Criteria**:
- Clear P0 objectives defined
- Budget allocated and approved
- KPIs measurable and time-bound
- Target audience well-defined

---

#### Phase 2: Campaign Design

**Purpose**: Design specific tactical campaigns to execute the strategic plan

**Key Activities**:
- Select campaigns aligned with plan objectives
- Choose appropriate marketing channels
- Set campaign timelines within plan period
- Allocate campaign budgets (sum should not exceed plan budget)
- Define campaign-specific KPIs

**Entities Created**:
- `Campaign` (status: draft → planned)
- `Channel` (as needed)

**Dependencies**:
- Requires approved `MarketingPlan`
- Campaign must link to parent plan via `plan_id`

**Typical Duration**: 3-7 days per campaign

**Success Criteria**:
- Campaign goals match plan objectives
- Campaign dates within plan period
- Campaign budgets sum to plan budget
- Channels appropriate for target audience

---

#### Phase 3: Content Creation

**Purpose**: Generate marketing content following brand guidelines

**Key Activities**:
- Apply brand voice and tone
- Follow content templates
- Create channel-specific content (respect constraints)
- Schedule content calendar

**Entities Used**:
- `ContentTemplate` (for guidelines)
- `Channel` (for platform constraints)
- `Project` (for brand voice)

**Typical Duration**: Ongoing throughout campaign

**Success Criteria**:
- Content follows brand guidelines
- Content respects channel constraints
- Content calendar populated

---

#### Phase 4: Execution

**Purpose**: Publish and distribute marketing content across channels

**Key Activities**:
- Publish content per schedule
- Track engagement metrics
- Update campaign status
- Monitor channel performance

**Entities Updated**:
- `Campaign` (status: planned → active)
- `Milestone` (if triggered)

**Tools Used**:
- `Tool` entities for automation (MCP preferred)

**Typical Duration**: Campaign duration (varies)

**Success Criteria**:
- Content published on schedule
- Metrics tracked and recorded
- Campaign status updated

---

#### Phase 5: Analytics & Optimization

**Purpose**: Analyze performance and generate optimization recommendations

**Key Activities**:
- Compare actual vs target KPIs
- Identify successes and concerns
- Generate AI-powered insights
- Create prioritized optimization recommendations

**Entities Created**:
- `Analytics` (for campaign or plan)

**Dependencies**:
- Requires completed or active `Campaign`
- Actual performance data available

**Typical Duration**: 1-3 days post-campaign

**Success Criteria**:
- All KPIs measured
- Insights generated (success/concern/opportunity)
- Optimization recommendations prioritized (high/medium/low)
- Learnings documented for next cycle

---

### Closed-Loop Marketing

The workflow is **cyclical**:

```
Q1 Campaign (Phase 1-5)
    ↓
Review & Optimize (Phase 5)
    ↓
Q2 Campaign (Phase 1-5 with optimizations)
    ↓
Continuous Improvement Loop...
```

**Key Principle**: Each cycle's Analytics informs the next cycle's Strategy.

## Extensibility

### Version Evolution

**Current Version**: 0.3.0 (Development Phase)

**Breaking Changes in v0.2.0**:
- `Campaign.plan_id` is now REQUIRED
- All campaigns must belong to a MarketingPlan

**Semantic Versioning**:
- **0.x.y**: Development phase - breaking changes allowed between releases
- **1.0.0**: First stable release - production-ready, API stability guaranteed
- **x.y.z**: Patch (z), Minor (y), Major (x) - follows semantic versioning

### Extensible Fields

**Enums**: All enum fields can be extended with new values in minor versions without breaking changes.

**Free-form Objects**: Fields like `kpis`, `constraints`, `config` accept arbitrary structures for domain-specific extensions.

### Future Considerations

Potential additions in future versions:
- A/B testing support
- Multi-variant campaigns
- Attribution modeling
- Competitive analysis
- Influencer marketing
- Event tracking
- Customer journey mapping

## Quality Validation

This specification is validated against:

- **Constitution Part II**: Specification Design Principles (6 principles)

## Notes

### Toolkit Implementation

This domain specification defines **data structures only**. For toolkit commands and workflow guidance, see:

- **Toolkit Specification**: `specs/toolkit/001-marketing-spec-kit-implementation/spec.md` (SDD)
- **SDM Commands**: `templates/sdm/commands/` (10 workflow commands)
- **Command Documentation**: `templates/sdm/README.md`

### Specification Operations

**This domain does NOT define specification operations** because:
- Marketing-spec-kit is NOT an API/Protocol specification
- It is a Speckit (Type B - Workflow-Guidance Toolkit)
- Commands are defined in the toolkit specification (SDD), not here (SDS)

**Refer to**: `specs/toolkit/` for all command definitions.
